# Retro-Snake-Game
I made the retro snake game with basic JAVA during the first summer break of 1st year B. Tech

The game is quite simple and works on the standard rules of the basic game mode of the game "Snake Xenzia". 
The game starts with 3 points, and we have to eat an Apple which is represented by the Red dot. Once eaten the Apple re-appears in 3 seconds to be eaten again
The game ends when the head of snake get struck with either the body or the tail itself.

Enjoy the Basic Retro Nostalgia from the good old NOKIA DAYS!
