# Retro-Snake-Game
Made the retro snake game with basic JAVA during the first summer break of 1st year B. Tech

The game is quite simple and works on standard rules of the basic game mode of the game "Snake Xenzia". 
The game starts with 3 points and we have to eat the apple which is represented by the Red dot. Once eatent he apple reappears in 3 seconds again. 
The game ends when the head of snake get struck with either the body or the tail itself.

Enjoy the Basic Retro Nostalgia!
